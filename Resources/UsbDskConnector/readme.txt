nocache.exe is a connector that allows you to communicate through websockets with DSO. This
application creates and opens "G:\SDK.BIN" file that is used for SDK commands transfer. After
connection was established (DSO displays debug message "SDK File Found" or something like that),
the connector application displays "ANS=(text, msg) Ready... Type 'REQ=your expression'" 
(a message generated by the DSO after it finds the SDK.BIN file).
Now you can start index.html with some web browser with WebSocket support. For some versions of
Mozilla Firefox, you will need to replace "WebSocket" with "MozWebSocket" and enable websockets
in about:config page.

The path to the SDK file is hard coded, please ensure that your DSO is mounted as "G:" drive,
or recompile the sources with your own settings.
